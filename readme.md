This repository started as a way to share progress on a Carpentries lesson with another instructor.
Now I am using it as a practice repository to understand better how GitHub CLI works.
The animals.csv file was added to practise with csv files. It originates from the Carpentries' [Unix Shell lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/#download-files)
